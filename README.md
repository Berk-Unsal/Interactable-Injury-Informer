# Injury Information Finder

This is a simple React application that allows users to click on an interactive anatomy diagram to learn about potential injuries in different muscle groups.

## Description

Clicking on a body part takes the user to a more detailed page listing specific sub-muscles. From there, the user can select a sub-muscle to view a list of possible injuries, their descriptions, and common causes.
